# Setting up authentication and recovery

The following can be set from GitHub account settings (once logged in, top right icon )

- Password
- Passkey
- Authenticator App (eg. Microsoft or Google authenticator)

In addition it is a good idea to take a copy of the recovery codes and store them away somewhere secure (e.g. a password-protected Word document ... )
